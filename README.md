Instanode
=========

Start the server from the command prompt by changing to the Instanode directory and then typing:

	node app.js

Create a file named instagram.txt in the root folder of the repository and paste your Instagram client id in it.

Enter the URL http://127.0.0.1:13337/instagram/stockholm to get some JSON stuff that you will have to figure out what to do with.

Static content goes in the static folder. The static/index.html file can be reached at:
